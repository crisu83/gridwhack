General information about the project.

GridWhack is a grid based 2D action role playing game inspired by [Nethack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nethack) and other [Roguelike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) games.

The idea behind GridWhack was to build a retro action role playing game that integrated ideas from modern games such as [Diablo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo), [World of Warcraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft), [Titan Quest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_quest), etc.

The player starts on the top level of a dungeon. There are no classes to allow the player to start playing immediately without spending time in character generation. Instead the character grows during his adventure.

The game does not have a town nor does it have useless items that will fill up the inventory all the time. Instead the player will find useful weapons, armor and power ups as his character advances deeper into the dungeon.

Almost all content is randomly generated which allows players to enjoy the game over and over again.
